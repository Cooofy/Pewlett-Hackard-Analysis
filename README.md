# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project to was to determine how many employees were retiring and out of the retiring employees how many of them were eligible to participate in the mentorship program to teach the new generation of staff.

### Results

1. Surprisingly we only have 2 managers retiring which says that either they are very young or each manger is managing a huge team and not many are needed.

2. We can clearly see in the image below that we are very senior heavy as majority of the staff that are retiring are senior engineers and senior staff.

3. Although we have a lot of staff retiring from different titles, we only have just over 1500 staff eligible for the mentorship program

4. Itâ€™s also surprising that there is not a lot of management personally retiring as we assume that the older or more time you put into the company you would be at a higher position at the end of your time with the company. 

### Summary
The exact number of roles that need to be filled is 90,398. The exact break down for each title shows below.

As we look at the above image, we can clearly see that there is a lot of staff retiring soon, however with the picture below we only have just over 1500 retiring staff eligible to mentor the next generation. With this the company must decide right away if they are going to have each mentor with a huge group which means that some people may not be able to pick or learn the required knowledge to be successful in their career. The company can also adjust its mentorship program so that there are enough mentors to handle all the new staff. However, the company can use this opportunity and see perhaps they do not need as much senior staff or senior engineers and only hire a reduced number.
