# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project to was to determine how many employees were retiring and out of the retiring employees how many of them were eligible to participate in the mentorship program to teach the new generation of staff.

### Results

1.) Surprisingly we only have 2 managers retiring which says that either they are very young or each manger is managing a huge team and not many are needed.
2.) We can clearly see in the image below that we are very senior heavy as majority of the staff that are retiring are senior engineers and senior staff.

3.) Although we have a lot of staff retiring from different titles, we only have just over 1500 staff eligible for the mentorship program
4.) Itâ€™s also surprising that there is not a lot of management personally retiring as we assume that the older or more time you put into the company you would be at a higher position at the end of your time with the company.
